CardKit was developed from a set of tools used in newsrooms; versions of this are employed by The Times, NPR, FT, Guardian, NYT, The Economist, and many others). However, it has many potential extended uses:

- Quotables and "what we know" listsicles
- Templated asset generation
- Video preview images (e.g. 16:9)
- Educational resources
- Advocacy and outreach
- Branding
